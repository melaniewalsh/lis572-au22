# This removes all existing variables from the Global Environment
rm(list=ls())

# You made a guest appearance in a Canadian TV show, and you got paid 250 Canadian dollars!

# Save this variable
my_canadian_payout <- 250

# Sweet! Wait, is that a lot?

# Let's create a function called cnd_to_usd() that converts currency from Canadian dollars to US dollars
  
# 1 Canadian dollar = 0.74 United States dollars
# You simply need to multiply the Canadian dollar amount by .74

# STEP 1: DEFINE A FUNCTION
# Fill in the necessary code below to create the function

a variable here <- function(argument / input value here) {
  
  us_value <- exchange rate * cnd_amount
  


# STEP 2: USE AND TEST THE FUNCTION

# Test the function 
cnd_to_usd(my_canadian_payout)

# Now run the function again and save the value in this variable
usd_payout <- 

# Print out the value
print(usd_payout)

# What happens if we try to print out the following variables?
print(cnd_amount)
print(us_payout)
# Do you see these variables in the global environment grid to the right? Why or why not? What does that mean?
